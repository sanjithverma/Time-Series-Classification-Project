# Time-Series-Classification-Project

Overview:
This project involves the development of a time-series classification model that accurately distinguishes between various human activities. The model's primary application is in the realm of sensor-based activity recognition, an area with significant implications in fields like healthcare, fitness, and human-computer interaction.

Features and Data Processing:
Data Source: The model utilizes time-series data collected from sensors. This data typifies different human activities and serves as the foundation for our classification tasks.
Feature Extraction: We have employed advanced statistical methods to extract relevant features from the raw sensor data. This feature extraction process is crucial to the model's effectiveness in distinguishing between various activities.
Algorithms Implemented:
L1 Multinomial Regression: This algorithm provides a robust baseline for our classification tasks, with a regularization technique that enhances model generalization.
Gaussian Naïve Bayes: A probabilistic classifier that assumes the independence of features, it's particularly effective for its simplicity and speed.
Multinomial Naïve Bayes: Another variant of Naïve Bayes, which is suitable for classification with discrete features like word counts in text classification.
